### 1.2 Project Background

##### Started from Polkadot Hackathon

The Web3Games team is formed of blockchain engineers with a mission to build a new game ecosystem on Polkadot. The core team met during a Substrate course co-hosted by Parity and OneBlock+, and competed against 33 other teams at the Polkadot Hackathon Demo Day to receive the Developers‚Äô Choice Award.

### 1.3 Project Integrated

Web3Games is based on the Substrate 3.0 Framework. We built numbers of pallets with NFT and DeFi and deployed on our Web3Games Testnet. Besides the substrate-based network, we also provide frontend and backend game client intergration libraries for players to kickstart the blockchain gaming journey easier. For developers, we open source all our contract libraries. Through the Front EVM bridge, developers can also write contracts with Ink or Solidity and deploy to our network, bringing Web 3.0 cross chain features.

### 1.4 Project Interest

Our team is built from experienced blockchain and game developers. With highly tailor made features in Substrate, blockchain gaming can be implemented much easier and provide a better environment for players.

### 1.5 Project Details 

Web3Games includes Web3Games Chian,Web3Games SDK.

![](https://web3games-public.oss-ap-northeast-1.aliyuncs.com/project-diagram.png)

- **Web3Game Chain** Already live on Polkadot.js App. We deployed all our pallet and contracts on it for development and testing purposes.
- **Game Product** Developed with Web3Games SDK. For demo and tutoral purposes.
- **Web3Game SDK** Help developers quickly develop blockchain games.

### Ecosystem Fit 

* Web3Games is built based on Substrate, aiming to become the collective blockchain for gaming and digital collectibles. For players, we provide more user-friendly blockchain games. For developers, we provide demo games for reference and development toolkit/SDK to lower the entry barrier of creating digital assets and provide blockchain servies. We would like to complete our roadmap and build the gaming ecosystem for the community in Web 3.0.

### Content Detail

##### Different from other projects„ÄêPallet„Äë

##### Project Advantages (Already Achieved)

The Web3Games GameSwap is designed precisely for gaming assets, and the Swap function module can be implemented right after unboxing. GamesSwap currently supports FT and NFT exchange, namely in-game content and assets, on-chain FT or NFTs. It can act as a DeFi tool to enable efficient circulation of gaming assets, for instance, by establishing a liquidity pool or liquidity providers for value mapping within the Web3Games ecosystem. By opening up the game economy to GameSwap, players will automatically deposit liquidity into the ecosystem and help maintain its stability. 

1. Safer assets - conventional projects store players‚Äô assets by deploying smart contracts, but once rollback occurs caused by contract problems on Substrate or other chains, such as contract attacks, logic programming issues, insufficient gas, abnormal network connection, Web3Games‚Äô smart contract library and through chain extension lets the contract directly apply on-chain pallets to store assets on the chain. GameSwap is not affected by common contract problems, as it uses players‚Äô assets on the chain for transactions to solve atomic swaps. Web3Games has also developed a mobile liquidity pool for users who need to swap their assets to deposit without incurring contract rollback, thereby ensuring transaction consistency and security. 

   

2. Lower transaction fees (higher performance from faster reading time)As mentioned, Web3Games contracts use on-chain pallets to store assets on the chain itself, so that during I/O contracts do not need to relay information back through the Contract Pallet. Reducing this step improves operational efficiency, and is equivalent to using weight rather than increasing gas. The more complicated the contract and in high frequency trading, the greater the reduced fees. This is a strong advantage of Swap, which enables the exchange economy within Web3Games and is a feature of the ecosystem‚Äôs blockchain games. 

   

3. Multicurrency support Inspired by other projects, GameSwap realized a multi-currency exchange function where game devs can establish value mapping between their game token and the Web3Games ecosystem. At the same time, the game token can also be value mapped with other ecosystems like Polkadot, allowing players to easily exchange their assets for other tokens. 

   

4. Cross-Chain GameSwap (To Be Achieved)Web3Games is equipped with a compatible bridge, currently the EVM for contract development, in a way similar to layer 2 networking. In the near future, transfer codes will be solved by using Solidity contracts to manipulate pallets on Substrate. Through Substrate‚Äôs intervention on the parachain, the XCMP can be used to complete cross-chain capabilities by developing different compatible transcoding. (Transcoding refers to converting to WASM or IR compiling to WAS M)

   

Token palletDifference from ERC20, 721, 1155, 1808 and other similar protocolsWeb3Games has its own complete token interface to facilitate most protocol implementation requirements without needing to deploy the same contract code on the chain, by adjusting parameters and avoiding misusing storage space on the chain. To meet the need for customization, we have opened up the contract library for niche implementations and experimental projects. The token pallet has already realized most of the interfaces as an open source for developers and users. 

1. Higher performance (initially executed with pallet Wasmtime, now contracts are using wasmi)We developed the layer 2 network through chain expansion and the contract library. The pallets allow contracts to be deployed using expansion codes so that developers do not need to code themselves.
2. Convenient integrated contractsIn our Token Pallet and Swap there is an instance code, which allows each game to deploy just one token contract to manage all FT and NFTs used in the game. The code is unique and only the person who deployed it can exercise authority. 



The Web3Games SDK includes all development files, project documents, tools, and libraries. Anything related to development of the ecosystem or the chain including tutorials and faucets can be found there. The core component SubGat, a blockchain game development framework is also within, which helps integrate login systems, registration of wallets, content creation, and backend portal support. It is used for I/O logic, chain link processing, authorization and different game editors to quickly interact with the chain. Configuration paths, layout mode, and other integration details are bundled. There is also a game server template, which specifies the management logic for the backend portal, data calculations, and log records. Finally, the Web3Games contract library and game examples are also part of the SDK. Unlike other similar projects, the Web3Games SDK is meant to be a full kit for building blockchain games.
